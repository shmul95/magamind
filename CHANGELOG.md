## Release 1.2.0 - Shmulsidian vault — 2026-05-13

Third stable release. Wires the shmulsidian Obsidian vault as a first-class Home Manager module with provider MCP/slash-command integration.

- New `private/shmulsidian.nix` module (example at `private/shmulsidian.nix.example`): clones the vault on first activation, scaffolds PARA folders, sets `PERSONAL_VAULT_PATH`, and wires MCP + slash commands for each enabled provider (claude-code, codex, copilot).
- Bypasses the broken `shmulsidian-template` `homeManagerModules.default` (its `providerImports = map providerModule cfg.providers` inside `mkMerge` forces `cfg.providers` during `pushDownProperties`, causing infinite recursion). Only the vault-scaffold sub-module is imported; providers are wired inline from the static `providers` extraSpecialArg.
- New `public/providers.nix` and `flake.cabanashmul.providers` option in `_options.nix` — single source of truth for the AI provider list shared by all modules.
- `_builder.nix` passes `providers = cab.providers` via `extraSpecialArgs` so home-manager modules receive it without reaching back into the flake-parts fixed point.
- New `flake.cabanashmul.overlays` option in `_options.nix`; `_builder.nix` applies overlays when instantiating pkgs.
- `get-shmul-done` bumped to `v1.0.2` (`cabanashmul` org): vault lifecycle (clone, scaffold, captureHook) removed from the module — lifecycle is now owned by the shmulsidian module.
- `CABANASHMUL_DIR` session variable set in `zshmul.nix` so `build-profiles` resolves correctly from any working directory.

## Release 1.1.0 - Get Shmul Done — 2026-05-08

Second stable release. v1.1 rounds out the starter flake with a clearer onboarding path, release-facing documentation, and the final public release marker for the milestone.

- The `get-shmul-done` section stays on by default in the docs, with a short `local.nix` customization snippet instead of a manual opt-in story.
- New scripts, covering the ergonomic `switch-profile` flags, `update-cabanashmul`, and `vault-init` Obsidian vault bootstrap surface.
- Onboarding docs now walk newcomers through the setup in a gentler order: concept primers up front, then install, bootstrap, configure, rebuild or switch, template updates, and troubleshooting. The landing page nav now jumps straight to the main sections people actually need.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-05-05

First stable release. The structure (public / private / profiles / secrets layers, dendritic auto-import, profile-based identity) is considered stable and the onboarding path has been validated end-to-end.

- Rewrote the README with a clear pitch, architecture diagram, and a linear "Get Started" walkthrough that includes prerequisites, Nix install, bootstrap, apply, verify, and troubleshooting steps for users new to Nix and Home Manager.
- `setup` script now clones the template over HTTPS by default so first-time users without a configured GitHub SSH key are no longer blocked. The `CABANASHMUL_TEMPLATE_URL` env var still allows opting into SSH.
- Profile selection now uses per-user flake outputs (`.#"$USER"` for the default profile, `.#"$USER"-<profile>` for explicit selection); `CABANASHMUL_PROFILE` is deprecated but still honored for backward compatibility.
- Reorganized documentation per directory (`public/`, `private/`, `profiles/`, `secrets/`, `scripts/`) with each folder's README explaining its own role.
- Added `build-profiles` and `switch-profile` helpers for near-instant profile activation without re-evaluating the flake.
- Visual polish: centered hero block, badge row, and family footer linking sibling repos (`zshmul`, `tshmux`, `shmulvim`).
